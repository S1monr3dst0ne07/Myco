# Myco Performance Monitoring System

This directory contains performance monitoring tools and benchmarks for Myco development.

## Structure
- `benchmarks/` - Performance benchmark suites
- `monitors/` - Real-time performance monitoring tools
- `baselines/` - Performance baseline data
- `reports/` - Generated performance reports

## Usage
1. Run benchmarks: `./performance/run_benchmarks.sh`
2. Monitor performance: `./performance/monitor_performance.sh`
3. Generate reports: `./performance/generate_report.sh`

## Performance Targets
- Loops: <5ms for 1M iterations
- Strings: <2ms for 10K operations
- Overall: 8x faster than Python minimum
- Goal: Near 0ms for basic operations

## Performance Budget
- Each feature: <5% performance degradation
- Critical paths: <1% performance degradation
- Syntax changes: <2% performance degradation
